  "description": "To provide graduate fellowship support for students in the Applied Mathematics Department at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
  "marketingContent": "<p>The Fund has been established in memory of Rudy Lee Horne, who received a Master’s degree in Physics, a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, and a Doctorate in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder. Dr. Horne was the first African American to graduate with a Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Mathematics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through this Fellowship, the Department seeks to increase the diversity of the Department’s student body and faculty, to maximize the educational benefits of diversity, and to increase the number of professors who can and will use diversity as a resource for enriching the education of all students. The hope is students who receive the Fellowship would, through their presence in the Department, contribute to the diversity of the Department and of the campus, and more generally, of the community of mathematicians. The commitment of this Fellowship is forward looking and inclusive, with the intention of having long-term impact to identify and attract students to the Department who can help transform the future.</p>\r\n",
