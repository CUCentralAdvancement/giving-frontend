It is now more obvious than ever that subnational actors are the ones on the ground doing the hard work to fight climate change and preserve our critical forests. With 38 members from 10 mainly tropical forest countries, the GCF Task Force has become the worldâ€™s largest network dedicated to promoting subnational leadership on tropical forest and climate issues. We continually look to build on the network's ambitious goals and could not do so without your support.</p>\r\n",
