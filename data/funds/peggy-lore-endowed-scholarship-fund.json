Through her work, Lore imparted onto countless students the skills needed to surmount the sometimes daunting challenge of completing college. As the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Success in the Division of Student Affairs, she helped to ensure services at CU Denver are welcoming and inclusive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peggy once noted, “Students have a lot of responsibilities in addition to going to school so sometimes I think if we don’t encourage students to develop things other than their academics, that students will be missing an opportunity. To me, it’s important for students to develop in a holistic way; benefitting from the full college experience.” \"</p>\r\n",
