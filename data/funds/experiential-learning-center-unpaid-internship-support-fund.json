  "description": "To support students participating in unpaid internships through the Experiential Learning Center at the University of Colorado Denver.",
  "marketingContent": "<p>Internships are extremely valuable in helping students explore professional career paths, develop new skills through real world experiences and make themselves more desirable hires following graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet these are often unpaid positions, requiring students to choose between the long-term benefits of an internship and working a job that may be unrelated, but helps pay their tuition and living expenses. Unpaid internships are especially common in specific industries including non-profits and the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Experiential Learning Center (ELC) at CU Denver helps students find worthwhile internships in their chosen field. Gifts to this fund will enable us to provide scholarship awards to qualifying students that are completing an unpaid internship.</p>\r\n",
