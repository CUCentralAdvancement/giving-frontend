  "marketingContent": "<p>This scholarship honors the longtime leadership of Coloradoâ€™s engagement with the European Union (EU) by Frieda Sanidas Leason and Bernard V. Leason. &nbsp;Daily escalations of tensions in the EU and across the world, engendered by a revival of nationalism and racial extremism, have made us increasingly aware of the need for global understanding and cooperation among nations. Thus, it has never been more important that this generation of students, and those to come, have a global view of issues that affect all humanity.</p>\r\n",
